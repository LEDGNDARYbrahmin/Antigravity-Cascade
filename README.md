## Introduction

**Antigravity Monitor** is a next-generation Serial Monitor and Device Manager designed for professionals who demand more than a scrolling text box. 

Currently optimized for **ESP32** ecosystems, it combines a robust Serial Console with advanced device management features like Filesystem exploration (SPIFFS/LittleFS). 

> **Current Status**: Windows Supported | ESP32 Optimized
> **Coming Soon**: macOS/Linux Support | Universal Board Support (Arduino, STM32, etc.)

## Key Features

### 🔌 Advanced Serial Monitor
- **Clean UI**: Modern, dark-themed interface focused on readability.
- **Custom Baud Rates**: Support for standard and non-standard baud rates.
- **Quick Macros**: Send pre-defined commands (RST, HELP, JSON) with a single click.
- **Auto-Scroll Control**: freeze traffic to inspect data without losing context.

### ESP32 Device Manager
- **Filesystem Explorer**: Browse SPIFFS/LittleFS/FATFS partitions directly from the UI.
- **Visual Management**: Upload, download, and delete files on your ESP32 wirelessly or via Serial (depending on firmware support).
- **Dashboard**: View real-time heap usage, signal strength (RSSI), and device info.
